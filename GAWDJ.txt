BEM
BEM is a coding concept that is en vogue
all selectors should directly target elements with classes instead of relying on
type selectors.
because the above limits the cascading of styles it allows us to move elements around
much more easily.
blocks can be nested in other blocks
you should identify patterns and then create single-responsibility blocks.
bem makes the realationship between html and css clearer. you know how a css rule
effects the html.

(B)lock
  - a chunk of code that is or can be reused more than once
(E)lement
  - a piece of a block that cannot be used outside of the block.
(M)odifier
  - a way to modify a block or element that changes their attributes.
  an example of this is to enable or disable (grey out) a block (like a button).
